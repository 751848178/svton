## Current Reading Rule

- For project/environment Devpilot work, start with this index, then read the
  active slice in `2026-06-25-existing-project-onboarding.md`, and finally read
  the relevant `docs-internal/devpilot/progress/P*.md` file.
- If a referenced progress file has not been restored yet, record that gap in
  the current slice before changing code.
